            Hej, I'm Krishna!
            <br/><br/>
            
            I work at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, working on security and compliance on various Office services.
            <br/><br/>
            
            Before that, I worked at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> on the <a href="https://payeecentral.amazon.com/">Payee Central</a> platform, dealing with automated invoicing system for corporate vendors across the globe.
            <br/><br/>

            Outside of work, I usually spend my time exploring and building useless tech stuff, and learn about them. I'm also working on developing a reading habit, and currently spending time reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Self-Deception-Getting-Out-Box/dp/1523097809/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">Leadership and self-deception</a> (not that it's amazing, but worth a read :p)
            <br/><br/>

            Soon I also plan on start writing some blogs related to tech and other stuff I'm interested in, so keep an eye. Always up for a â˜•, so shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:purohitkrishnar@gmail.com">purohitkrishnar@gmail.com</a> if you wanna chat.
        </div>
